#Cribbage Season Setup
## Set up season name
This is set in the cribbage.cfg module.
The only thing that needs to be changed is teh season variable.
Everything else should remain the same.

## Set up season report directory
This is in the datebase for the club. It is a column in the row for the club director.
It should be change to <new season>/Reports/ and the directory needs to be created by hand.
